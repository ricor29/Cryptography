# Cryptography

Understanding fundamentals

My notes from learning about cryptography. A series of examples of implementing crypto agorithms from the classics, stream/block, elliptic and diffie. In addition some cryptanalysis on the simpler algorithms. Several books aided this from Implementing Cryptography using python, Real-World Cryptography, and Learn Quantum Computing with Python and Q#.
